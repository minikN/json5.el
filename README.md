# JSON5 major more for Emacs using tree-sitter
As of now, this is more or less a carbon copy of `json-ts-mode`.

# Installation
This package is in very early development and currently not available in
MELPA / ELPA.
- Clone the repo
- `(load "/path/to/json5.el")`

# Usage
You need to have the tree-sitter grammar for [JSON5](https://github.com/Joakker/tree-sitter-json5) available in emacs.
There are multiple ways on how to do this. Once this is done, you can check if you have the grammar available with

```lisp
(treesit-available-p 'json5)
```

If that returns `t`, you are good to go.

# Bugs

- more

# TODO
- Fix bugs
- Add license

# Contribution
PR's are very welcome. I've never written a tree-sitter major mode, and as of now, I don't really know what I'm doing
and am just playing around. This is not in a usable state as of yet.
